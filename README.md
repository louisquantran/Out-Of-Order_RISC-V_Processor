# Out-Of-Order RISC-V RTL Project

This repository contains my **independent implementation** of an out-of-order RISC-V processor in SystemVerilog.
The design is **actively under development** and currently supports a subset of RISC-V instructions (R, I, S, L type).

A **completed team-based implementation** of a similar architectur, **which I contributed to**,  is available here:
